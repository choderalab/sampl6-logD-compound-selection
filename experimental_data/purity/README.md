## Purity of SAMPL6 pKa challenge solid compound stocks

LC-MS based purity measurements were performed by Heather Wang (Merck).


### LC-MS Method 
The purity analysis was performed using an Agilent HPLC1200 Series equipped with auto-sampler, UV diode array detector and a Quadrupole MS detector 6140. Software was used is Chemistation for LC & LC/MS with version C01.07SR2.    
The column for the analysis is Assentis Express C18 3.0x100mm 2.7Âµl particle size at Column temperature=45C.  
Mobile phase A: 2mM ammonium formate ( pH=3.5) aqueous  
Mobile phase B: 2mM ammonium formate in Acetonitrile : Water=90:10 ( pH=3.5)   
Flow rate=0.75ml/min  
Gradient: Starting with 10% B to 95%B in 10minutes then hold 95%B for 5minutes. Post run = 5 minutes 
Mass condition: ESI positive and negative mode  
Capillary voltage=3000V  
Grying gas flow=12ml/min  
Nebulizer press=35psi  
Drying temperature=350C  
Mass range: 5-~1350Da; Fraggmentor:70;  Threshold:100

Area% for main peak  is calculated based on area of main peak divided by total area of all peaks.
