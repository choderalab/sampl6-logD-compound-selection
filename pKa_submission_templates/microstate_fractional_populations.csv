# PREDICTION SECTION
#
# Microstate ID of the predicted microstate should be recorded in the first column. 
# Consecutive columns heads indicate the pH value at which ln(fractional microstate population) should be predicted.
# Use scientific notation with 3 decimals of precision.
# Add new lines for each microstate.
# Leave csv sections you don't have estimates for empty.
# Do not report error estimates in this section. You can report error estimates in Method secton.
# 
# The data in each prediction line should be structured as follows:
# Microstate ID,2.00,2.10,2.20,2.30,2.40,2.50,2.60,2.70,2.80,2.90,3.00,3.10,3.20,3.30,3.40,3.50,3.60,3.70,3.80,3.90,4.00,4.10,4.20,4.30,4.40,4.50,4.60,4.70,4.80,4.90,5.00,5.10,5.20,5.30,5.40,5.50,5.60,5.70,5.80,5.90,6.00,6.10,6.20,6.30,6.40,6.50,6.60,6.70,6.80,6.90,7.00,7.10,7.20,7.30,7.40,7.50,7.60,7.70,7.80,7.90,8.00,8.10,8.20,8.30,8.40,8.50,8.60,8.70,8.80,8.90,9.00,9.10,9.20,9.30,9.40,9.50,9.60,9.70,9.80,9.90,10.00,10.10,10.20,10.30,10.40,10.50,10.60,10.70,10.80,10.90,11.00,11.10,11.20,11.30,11.40,11.50,11.60,11.70,11.80,11.90,12.00
