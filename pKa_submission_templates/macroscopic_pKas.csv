#
# Add new lines for each predicted molecule.
# Leave csv sections you don't have estimates for empty.
# Report pKas with 2 decimal places.
# 
# The data in each prediction line should be structured as follows:
# Molecule ID, macroscopic pKa, macroscopic pKa SEM
# The list of predictions must begin with the "Prediction:" keyword, as illustrated here.
