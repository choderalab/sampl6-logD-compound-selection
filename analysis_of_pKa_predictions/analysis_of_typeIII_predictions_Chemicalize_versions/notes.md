### Analysis of typeIII submissions together with 2 Chemicalize submissions.

I included two versions of Chemicalize predictions to the analysis of typeIII predictions to see where do they stand in comparison to performance of other methods.
In the overview paper I only intend to report on the recent version of Chemicalize: `nb015-976-typeIII-Chemicalize-2.csv`.

To run the whole analysis: 
$ source run.sh
