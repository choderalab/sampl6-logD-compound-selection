# Submission Type III
#
# Any line that begins with a # is considered a comment and will be ignored when parsing.
#
# PREDICTION SECTION
#
# Each submission (method) must have a completed `typeIII_macroscopic_pKas.csv` file for all molecules the prediction encompasses.
# For each molecule, report as many macroscopic pKas as your method predicts. 
# Add new lines for each predicted molecule.
# For molecules with multiple macroscopic pKas report each macroscopic pKa in a new line.
# Report pKa values to two decimal places (e.g. 10.71).
# Reporting the standard error of the mean (SEM) is optional and encouraged. If it is reported, SEM should be reported to two decimal places (e.g. 1.02).
# For values for which you don't have an estimate, leave that cell of the csv table empty.
#
# The data in each prediction line should be structured as follows:
# Molecule ID, macroscopic pKa, macroscopic pKa SEM
# The list of predictions must begin with the "Predictions:" keyword, as illustrated here.

Method: 
Frequency calculations for all the microstates are done at their optimized structures in implicit solvent model (SMD model is used here) to obtain the free energy in aqueous solution phase.
M06-2X/6-31G* is used for neutral (NEU) and positively (POS) charged microstates, and M06-2X/6-31+G* is used for neutral (NEU) and negatively (NEG) charged microstates.
Single point correction has been made by doing an additional single point energy calculation using larger basis set.

The free energy in aqueous solution for each microstate is, for NEU and POS, G=E(SMD)(6-311G**)+G_corr(SMD)(6-31G*); for NEU and NEG, G=E(SMD)(6-311++G**)+G_corr(SMD)(6-31+G*).
Then the partition function for each microstate is exp(-G/kT). Here T is the temperature at Kelvin (which is set as 298.15), k is the Boltzmann constant (0.0019872036 kcal/(mol*K)).
So the macroscopic pKa will be pKa(n+1/n)=-\lg\sum\exp(-G(n)/kT)+\lg\sum\exp(-G(n+1)/kT)+G(H)/(kT\ln(10)). Here G(H) is the free energy of a proton in aqueous solution, which is set to -271.88 kcal/mol.
