#
# PREDICTION SECTION
#
# Each submission (method) must have a completed `typeIII_macroscopic_pKas.csv` file for all molecules the prediction encompasses.
# For each molecule, report as many macroscopic pKas as your method predicts. 
# Add new lines for each predicted molecule.
# For molecules with multiple macroscopic pKas report each macroscopic pKa in a new line.
# Report pKa values to two decimal places (e.g. 10.71).
# Reporting the standard error of the mean (SEM) is optional and encouraged. If it is reported, SEM should be reported to two decimal places (e.g. 1.02).
# For values for which you don't have an estimate, leave that cell of the csv table empty.
#
# The data in each prediction line should be structured as follows:
# Molecule ID, macroscopic pKa, macroscopic pKa SEM
# The list of predictions must begin with the "Predictions:" keyword, as illustrated here.

Method: 
For each ligand, we used pKa-Prospector's default ion identification algorithm to assess ionizable groups. For compounds [], these were supplemented based on chemical principles. Initially we used the default 'Analog Search' method to identify one or more compounds with similar ionizable groups and similar nearby chemistry. In cases where these compounds were deemed insufficient [], we used pKa-Prospector's 'Substructure Search' and 'Similarity Search' functions to supplement the original analog lists. We used the series of analog molecules with measured pKa data to assign an approximate macroscopic pKa value (and error) for each ionization transition. Since the distribution of measured pKa values does not form a uniformal nor independent distribution about the ionization of interest, we applied simple concepts of chemical perturbations to estimate the predictions.

We searched the default pKa data available in pKa-Prospector 1.0.0.3.  This includes data from the four sources listed below as collected and annotated by Tony Slater.
