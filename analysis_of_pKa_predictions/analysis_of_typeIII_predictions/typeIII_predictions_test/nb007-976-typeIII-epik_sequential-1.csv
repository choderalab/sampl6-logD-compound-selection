# PREDICTION SECTION
#
# Each submission (method) must have a completed `typeIII_macroscopic_pKas.csv` file for all molecules the prediction encompasses.,,
# For each molecule, report as many macroscopic pKas as your method predicts. ,,
# Add new lines for each predicted molecule.,,
# For molecules with multiple macroscopic pKas report each macroscopic pKa in a new line.,,
# Report pKa values to two decimal places (e.g. 10.71).,,
# Reporting the standard error of the mean (SEM) is optional and encouraged. If it is reported, SEM should be reported to two decimal places (e.g. 1.02).,,
# For values for which you don't have an estimate, leave that cell of the csv table empty.,,
#
# The data in each prediction line should be structured as follows:,,
# Molecule ID, macroscopic pKa, macroscopic pKa SEM",,
# The list of predictions must begin with the ""Predictions:"" keyword, as illustrated here.,,

Method: 
Microstate populations for the SAMPL6 pKa molecules were predicted using Epik from the 2017-2 Schrodinger suite.
The SMILES structure provided in the MobleyLab/SAMPL6 github repo was used as input for ligprep. A single, neutral tautomer of the molecule with a 3d structure was generated. This structure was then used as input for Epik calculations.
Epik calculations were run in scan mode to predict pKa values between 2.0 and 12.0, starting at the structure predicted for pH 7.4.

Results were processed using pandas. Scripts are available at https://github.com/choderalab/SAMPL6-Epik-pKa
