### Microstate analysis of Type I predictions for  4-aminoquinazoline series 

Using closest algorithm, predicted pKa values were matched to experimental pKa values. 
For type I predictions participants have also reported Microstate ID pairs of each of their predicted pKa values.
Based on NMR experiments of SM07, assuming similar scaffolds will keep the same protonation order, I prepared a table of experimental microstate pairs:
