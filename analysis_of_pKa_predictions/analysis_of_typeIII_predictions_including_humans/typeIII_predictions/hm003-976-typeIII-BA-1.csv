# PREDICTION SECTION,,
#,,
# Each submission (method) must have a completed `typeIII_macroscopic_pKas.csv` file for all molecules the prediction encompasses.,,
# For each molecule report as many macroscopic pKas as your method predicts.,,
# Add new lines for each predicted molecule.,,
# For molecules with multiple macroscopic pKas report each macroscopic pKa in a new line.,,
# Report pKa values to two decimal places (e.g. 10.71).,,
# Reporting the standard error of the mean (SEM) is optional and encouraged. If it is reported SEM should be reported to two decimal places (e.g. 1.02).,,
# For values for which you don't have an estimate leave that cell of the csv table empty.,,
#,,
# The data in each prediction line should be structured as follows:,,
# Molecule ID, macroscopic pKa, macroscopic pKa SEM
# The list of predictions must begin with the 'Predictions:' keyword as illustrated here.,,

Method:
The predictions are based on experience of deprotonating such functional groups and understanding the conjugate base stability.
The uncertainty was estimated by calculating the standard error in the mean over 10 replicate calculations.
