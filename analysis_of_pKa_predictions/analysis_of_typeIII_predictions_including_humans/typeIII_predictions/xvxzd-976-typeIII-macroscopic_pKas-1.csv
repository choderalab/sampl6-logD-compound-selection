# PREDICTION SECTION
#
# Each submission (method) must have a completed `typeIII_macroscopic_pKas.csv` file for all molecules the prediction encompasses.
# For each molecule, report as many macroscopic pKas as your method predicts. 
# Add new lines for each predicted molecule.
# For molecules with multiple macroscopic pKas report each macroscopic pKa in a new line.
# Report pKa values to two decimal places (e.g. 10.71).
# Reporting the standard error of the mean (SEM) is optional and encouraged. If it is reported, SEM should be reported to two decimal places (e.g. 1.02).
# For values for which you don't have an estimate, leave that cell of the csv table empty.
#
# The data in each prediction line should be structured as follows:
# Molecule ID, macroscopic pKa, macroscopic pKa SEM
# The list of predictions must begin with the "Predictions:" keyword, as illustrated here.

Method: 
We calculated free energies at a high level of theory to then use the linear free energy relationship (LFER) for the calculation of pKa values.
Starting structures were created from the provided SMILES strings with the OpenBabel program.
For each of the 24 molecules possible tautomers were automatically generated and screened at the GFN-xTB level.
Conformational ensembles were created for all tautomers, using the MF-MD-GC algorithm as published in Angew.Chem.Int.Ed, 2017, 56, 14763.
Protonated and deprotonated species were automatically calculated using the xTB program, as described in JCC, 2017, 38, 2618-2631.
Only singly protonated/deprotonated ions were considered for the pKa calculations. Conformational searches were then again performed for all ions.
All GFN-xTB calculations were conducted using the GBSA implicit solvation model for water.
After structure creation at the GFN-xTB level of theory, all geometries were optimized at the PBEh-3c level, including implicit solvation for water with a self consitent implementation of the COSMO-RS model (DCOSMO-RS).
These geometries were then used to calculate electronic energies at the DSD-BLYP-D3(BJ)/def2-TZVPD//PBEh-3c[DCOSMO-RS] level, where the RIJK approximation was used.
Contributions to the free energy at 298 K in the RRHO approximation were calculated at the GFN-xTB[GBSA] level. Solvation contributions were calculated using COSMO-RS, in the BP86/TZVPD parametrization of 2014.
Boltzmann weights were calculated for all conformers, protomers/deprotomers and tautomers. The complete level of theory reads:
DSD-BLYP-D3(BJ)/def2-TZVPD//PBEh-3c[DCOSMO-RS] + RRHO(GFN-xTB[GBSA]) + Gsolv(COSMO-RS[TZVPD])

Since pKa values can be calculated from the free energies for the loss of a proton from a molecule, the free enthalpy (dG) for the reaction of the molecule with water is calculated. Here, 
water is represented by small water clusters taken from the WATER27 subset of the GMTKN55 benchmark set.
The free enthalpy of the reaction is related to the pKa value by the LFER, stating that 
pKa = A * dG/ln(10)RT + B.
The constants A and B are fitted to a set of experimental pKa values, as described by Klamt in J.Phys.Chem.A, 2003, 107, 9380-9386. The same molecules as in this publication were used for the fit.
The determined constants A and B are:
A =  0.566461  +/- 0.02559
B = -1.1473    +/- 0.3487
MAD and RMSD (in pKa units) for the fit molecules are:
MAD  0.72
RMSD 0.98
Although the MAD and RMSD are larger compared to the original publication, the much better physics of our approach seems to be reflected in the regression parameter B, which is now closer to its theoretical value of -1.74.
The SEM given above exclusively correspond to the Asymptotic Standard Error of the regression.
