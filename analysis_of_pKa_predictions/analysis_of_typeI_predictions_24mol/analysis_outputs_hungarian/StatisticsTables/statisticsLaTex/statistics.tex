Notes

- In this analysis we assumed well separated experimental macroscopic pKas represent microscopic pKas. Molecules with experimental pKa values at least 3 units apart were considered

well-separated. SM14 and SM18 which do not satify this criteria are ignored in this analysis.

- Mean and 95\% confidence intervals of statistic values were calculated by bootstrapping.

- pKa predictions of Epik, Jaguar, Chemicalize, and MoKa were not blind (submission IDs noted as nbXXX). They were submitted after the submission deadline as reference methods.

- pKas of the rest of the molecules in these submissions were blindly predicted before experimental data was released.
