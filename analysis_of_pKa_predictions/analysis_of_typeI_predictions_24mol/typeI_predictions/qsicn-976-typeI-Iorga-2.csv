Toward the accurate calculation of pKa values in water and acetonitrile. Biochim Biophys Acta. 2013, 1827, 882-891.We calculated the pKa for a representative dataset of 38 compounds with known experimental pKa values spanning from -3.00 and 17.10.The experimental values compared with the energy corresponding to the difference between the experimental and computed pKa values were plotted for two separate groups containing neutral to negative and positive to neutral transformations. Linear fitting of these values (R2=0.98273 and 0.97468, respectively) using Microsoft Excel provided the correction to be applied to the SAMPL6 pKa calculations.Therefore, the microscopic pKa values reported here are the computed pKa values corrected with the corresponding coefficient, according to the transformation type, in order to remove the systematic error.A number of Gaussian09 calculations could not converge using the D.01 version, but converged without problems using the A.02 version.
