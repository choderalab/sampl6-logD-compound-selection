# Submission Type I

# Any line that begins with a # is considered a comment and will be ignored when parsing.
#
# PREDICTION SECTION
#
# Each submission (method) must have a completed `typeI_microscopic_pKas_and_microstates.csv` file for all molecules the prediction encompasses.
# For each molecule, report as many microscopic pKas as your method predicts.
# Add new lines for each microstate pair.
# Report microscopic pKa values to two decimal places (e.g. 10.71).
# Reporting the standard error of the mean (SEM) is optional, but if reported, two decimal places should be provided (e.g. 1.02).
# For values which you don't have an estimate, leave that cell of the csv table empty.
#
# The data in each prediction line should be structured as follows:
# microstate ID of protonated state(HA), microstate ID of deprotonated state(A), microscopic pKa, microscopic pKa SEM
# The list of predictions must begin with the "Predictions:" keyword, as illustrated here.

Method: 
Similar as earlier methods except that the implicit solvent QM solvation of the molecule is replaced by an explicit solvent MM calculation.
Geometries are optimized with MP2 method using 6-31G* basis set.
Parameters are generated using Antechamber's resp method.
Free energy difference is calculated using pert module of charmm
solvation free energy of proton used is -265.6 kcal/mol.
