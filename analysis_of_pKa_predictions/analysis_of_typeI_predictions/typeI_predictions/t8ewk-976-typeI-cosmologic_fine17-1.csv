# NAME SECTION
Name:
COSMOlogic_FINE17

# SOFTWARE SECTION
Software:
COSMOtherm C30_1701
Turbomole 7.2
COSMOconf 4.2
COSMOquick version 1.6
COSMOpy (version2017) & Python 2.7

# METHODS SECTION
Method:
For the general workflow please refer to the method section of our typeIII submission.
Please note that for  COSMOtherm pKa predictions, which are based on the free energy difference of sets of conformers, which can comprise different "sample microstates", the scheme given here is not fully applicable.
For reference purposes, each pKa value has been attributed to the most stable conformer in water.
