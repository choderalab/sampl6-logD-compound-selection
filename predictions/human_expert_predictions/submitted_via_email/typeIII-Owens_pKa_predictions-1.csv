# Submission Type III,,
#,,
# Any line that begins with a # is considered a comment and will be ignored when parsing.,,
#,,
# PREDICTION SECTION,,
#,,
# Each submission (method) must have a completed `typeIII_macroscopic_pKas.csv` file for all molecules the prediction encompasses.,,
# For each molecule report as many macroscopic pKas as your method predicts. ,,
# Add new lines for each predicted molecule.,,
# For molecules with multiple macroscopic pKas report each macroscopic pKa in a new line.,,
# Report pKa values to two decimal places (e.g. 10.71).,,
# Reporting the standard error of the mean (SEM) is optional and encouraged. If it is reported SEM should be reported to two decimal places (e.g. 1.02).,,
# For values for which you don't have an estimate leave that cell of the csv table empty.,,
#,,
# The data in each prediction line should be structured as follows:,,
# Molecule ID, macroscopic pKa, macroscopic pKa SEM
# The list of predictions must begin with the 'Predictions:' keyword as illustrated here.,,
