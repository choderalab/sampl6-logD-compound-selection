# Submission Type III
#
# Any line that begins with a # is considered a comment and will be ignored when parsing.
#
# PREDICTION SECTION
#
# Each submission (method) must have a completed `typeIII_macroscopic_pKas.csv` file for all molecules the prediction encompasses.
# For each molecule, report as many macroscopic pKas as your method predicts. 
# Add new lines for each predicted molecule.
# For molecules with multiple macroscopic pKas report each macroscopic pKa in a new line.
# Report pKa values to two decimal places (e.g. 10.71).
# Reporting the standard error of the mean (SEM) is optional and encouraged. If it is reported, SEM should be reported to two decimal places (e.g. 1.02).
# For values for which you don't have an estimate, leave that cell of the csv table empty.
#
# The data in each prediction line should be structured as follows:
# Molecule ID, macroscopic pKa, macroscopic pKa SEM
# The list of predictions must begin with the "Predictions:" keyword, as illustrated here.

Method: 
This submission came out of conversations with some of the SAMPL6 organizers. In these discussion, we floated the idea of a human expert submission for the pKa predictions. Personally, I do not consider myself an expert on pKa values, but unlike some of the others in this discussion, my academic background is in chemistry. I combined my chemical intuition and substructure searches in OpenEyeâ€™s pKa prospector to come up with an estimate for the macro pKas for each molecule. 
I considered the available substructures and estimated a standard error of the mean that reflects my personal intuition about the accuracy of the estimated pKa. 
The goal of this process was to provide a guess from a human expert rather than a computational method. I took advantage of pKa prospector to assist where I have less organic chemistry expertise.
