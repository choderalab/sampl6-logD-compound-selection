#
# PREDICTION SECTION
#
# Each submission (method) must have a completed `typeII_microstate_fractional_populations.csv` file for all molecules the prediction encompasses.
# For each molecule, report as many microstates as your method predicts.
# Add new lines for each predicted microstate.
# Microstate ID of the predicted microstate should be recorded in the first column.
# Consecutive columns must be used to report ln(fractional microstate population) values of your predicted microstate at the pH value indicated by column title.
# e.g. In column 3 report ln(fractional microstate population) at pH 2.10 of your predicted microstate.
# Use scientific notation with 3 decimals of precision (e.g. -2.30e0 or 3.14e-4).
# For microstates predicted to have 0 populations, instead of ln(0), report as "-infinity".
# Do not report error estimates in this section. 
# For pH values which you don't have an estimate of ln(fractional microstate population), leave that cell or line of the csv table empty.
# 
# The ln(fractional microstate population) data in each prediction line should be structured as follows:
# Microstate ID,2.00,2.10,2.20,2.30,2.40,2.50,2.60,2.70,2.80,2.90,3.00,3.10,3.20,3.30,3.40,3.50,3.60,3.70,3.80,3.90,4.00,4.10,4.20,4.30,4.40,4.50,4.60,4.70,4.80,4.90,5.00,5.10,5.20,5.30,5.40,5.50,5.60,5.70,5.80,5.90,6.00,6.10,6.20,6.30,6.40,6.50,6.60,6.70,6.80,6.90,7.00,7.10,7.20,7.30,7.40,7.50,7.60,7.70,7.80,7.90,8.00,8.10,8.20,8.30,8.40,8.50,8.60,8.70,8.80,8.90,9.00,9.10,9.20,9.30,9.40,9.50,9.60,9.70,9.80,9.90,10.00,10.10,10.20,10.30,10.40,10.50,10.60,10.70,10.80,10.90,11.00,11.10,11.20,11.30,11.40,11.50,11.60,11.70,11.80,11.90,12.00

Method: 
To predict microstate populations, example method A was used, with all details described as follows: ... 
The p1 parameter was set to 1, and the p2 parameter was set to 0. 
The uncertainty was estimated by calculating the standard error in the mean over 10 replicate calculations.
