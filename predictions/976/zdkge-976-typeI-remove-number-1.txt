#
# PREDICTION SECTION
#
# Each submission (method) must have a completed typeI_microscopic_pKas_and_microstates.csv file for all molecules the prediction encompasses.
# For each molecule, report as many microscopic pKas as your method predicts.
# Add new lines for each microstate pair.
# Report microscopic pKa values to two decimal places (e.g. 10.71).
# Reporting the standard error of the mean (SEM) is optional, but if reported, two decimal places should be provided (e.g. 1.02).
# For values which you don't have an estimate, leave that cell of the csv table empty.
#
# The data in each prediction line should be structured as follows:
# microstate ID of protonated state(HA), microstate ID of deprotonated state(A), microscopic pKa, microscopic pKa SEM
# The list of predictions must begin with the "Prediction:" keyword, as illustrated here.

Method: 
To predict the pKa values, example method A was used, with all details described as follows: ... 
The p1 parameter was set to 1, and the p2 parameter was set to 0. 
The uncertainty was estimated by calculating the standard error in the mean over 10 replicate calculations.
