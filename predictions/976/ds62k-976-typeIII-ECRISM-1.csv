Method:
A single geometry per microstate (or two if a formal E-/Z-isomer was not specified in the SMILES string) was generated using Maestro 2017-2/Macromodel with the OPLS3/Water force field with mixed torsional/low-mode sampling, 100 steps per RB and 1000 steps max (default parameters).
The resulting conformations were optimized using Gaussian 09revE01 with IEF-PCM using default settings for water and B3LYP/6-311+G(d,p). Due to the limitations of the basis set, iodine was replaced with bromine in compounds where it occured.

These conformations were treated with EC-RISM/MP2/6-311+G(d,p)/PSE2 [REF1] and the resulting free energies of solvation reparametrized with respect to the MNSol hydration free energies [REF2] as min[deltaG_exp-((E_{EC-RISM}+c1*mu_{ex}+c2*PMV_{EC-RISM}+c3*q)-E_{vac}] with E_{EC-RISM} being the QM-energy of the molecule after convergence of the EC-RISM cycle, mu_{ex} the excess chemical potential, PMV_{EC-RISM} the partial molar volume as calculated by EC-RISM, q being the net charge of the molecule and E_{vac} taken from the same quantum chemical level of theory in vacuum. This correction (c1*mu_{ex}+c2*PMV_{EC-RISM}+c3*q) was then applied to the raw EC-RISM energies.
These yield G_{mtc} where m refers to the ionization state, t to the tautomer (microstate per ionization state) and c to the respective conformation. The different statistical weights of conformations were taken into account by computing the free energy of the resulting discrete partition function G_{mt}=-RT*ln[sum_c(exp(-G_{mtc}/RT))]. Using a similar partition function over tautomer states yields the ionization state-specific free energy G_{m}. For deprotonation processes, pKa_{raw}=(G_{k}-G_{k-1})/(RT ln(10)) and the bulk pKa follows from m*pKa_{raw}+b where parameters m and b are calculated within the chosen level of theory by fitting to the reference data set from [REF3].

Type 3: Macrostate pKa's between two ionization states (i,j) of the same compound differing by one elementary charge were calculated similarly to the pKa parametrization by pKa=m*(G_{i}-G_{j})/(RT ln(10))+b, where G_{m} refers to the partition function estimate of the ionization state-specific free energy by summing over the tautomer states.

The uncertainty was estimated as the maximum RMSE of all submitted methods from the pKa training dataset.
