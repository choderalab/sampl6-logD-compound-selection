# Submission Type III
#
# Any line that begins with a # is considered a comment and will be ignored when parsing.
#
# PREDICTION SECTION
#
# Each submission (method) must have a completed `typeIII_macroscopic_pKas.csv` file for all molecules the prediction encompasses.
# For each molecule, report as many macroscopic pKas as your method predicts. 
# Add new lines for each predicted molecule.
# For molecules with multiple macroscopic pKas report each macroscopic pKa in a new line.
# Report pKa values to two decimal places (e.g. 10.71).
# Reporting the standard error of the mean (SEM) is optional and encouraged. If it is reported, SEM should be reported to two decimal places (e.g. 1.02).
# For values for which you don't have an estimate, leave that cell of the csv table empty.
#
# The data in each prediction line should be structured as follows:
# Molecule ID, macroscopic pKa, macroscopic pKa SEM
# The list of predictions must begin with the "Predictions:" keyword, as illustrated here.

Method: 
The goal of this submission was to have an experimental guess. The idea is that
these estimations would be similar to what a human expert might guess based
on the chemical substructures in a molecule. As I am not personally an expert 
in estimating pKa from the structure of a molecule, I used OpenEye Scientific's 
pKa Prospector to perform a substructure search on each molecule and submitted 
an estimate for the macro pKa based on matching the ionizable groups 
identified by pKa prospector. The uncertainties specified in pKa prospector are
based on the experimental data for that specific molecule. I have provided an 
estimation for the uncertainty based on my intuition about the molecules 
found in pKa prospector. In all cases, my estimations are reported
