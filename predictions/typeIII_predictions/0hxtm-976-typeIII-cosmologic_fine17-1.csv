Method:
The pKa dataset consists of 24 small to medium sized drug-like molecules which combine several functional groups whereas most of them have at least one basic functional group. Molecules SM01, SM08, SM15, SM20 and SM22 possess an additional (significant) acidic functional group 
Possible deprotonated and protonated species (anions, cations, zwitterions) have been generated automatically via the COSMOquick software package. A few further potential ions and tautomers were determined from visual inspection of the neutral forms as provided for the challenge. In all cases, only single protonation or deprotonation turned out to be relevant at the experimental region from pH=2 to pH=12.
For all compounds, including the ionic and tautomeric forms, independent sets of relevant conformations were computed with the COSMOconf 4.2 workflow. Additional neutral conformers which are thermodynamically relevant in water according to COSMOtherm computations have been found only for compound SM18 (tautomeric) and SM22 (zwitterionic) and have been included into the respective conformer sets used later on for the COSMOtherm pKa calculations.
The quantum chemistry calculations of COSMO sigma-surfaces were done at the BP//TZVPD//FINE single point level based upon BP//TZVP//COSMO optimized geometries to match the parameterization (BP-TZVPD-FINE-C30-1701) used in the 2017 COSMOtherm-release. All quantum chemical calculations were carried out with the TURBOMOLE 7.2 quantum chemistry software.
The COSMOtherm pka-module uses a simple linear free energy relationship (LFER) in order to correct the free energy differences of the neutral and protonated (deprotonated) forms. ( Klamt, A. et al. J. Phys. Chem. A 107, 9380–9386 (2003). & Eckert et al. J Comp Chem 27, 11–19 (2006).):
pKa = c0 + c1*(DG_neutral-DG_ionic)
with 
c0=-131.7422 and c1=0.4910 mol/kcal (for acids in water)
c0=-171.1748 and c1=0.6227 mol/kcal (for bases in water)

pKa values were computed for all identified single protonated and deprotonated sampl6 molecules and the respective zwitterions using the COSMO-RS method as implemented in the COSMOtherm software. The workflow for the batch computation about 80 pKa reactions has been automated via an in-house script based on Python 2.7 (COSMOpy).
For the final submission, only relevant pKa-values were included. For bases all protonation reactions with predicted pKa>0 and for acids all pKa values <14 were selected.
The pKa value of basic molecule SM14 containing 2 equivalent basic groups according to our calculations was corrected by the addition of log10(2).
The accuracy of the pKa prediction with the current COSMOtherm parameterization is about 0.65 log units root mean squared deviation (RMSD). The RMSD was evaluated on a validation set of about 160 basic and acidic compounds having a fairly simple molecular structure. However, due to the somewhat more complex structure of the sampl6 molecules the mean of the expected error may be somewhat higher.
