# PREDICTION SECTION
#
# Each submission (method) must have a completed `typeIII_macroscopic_pKas.csv` file for all molecules the prediction encompasses.
# For each molecule, report as many macroscopic pKas as your method predicts. 
# Add new lines for each predicted molecule.
# For molecules with multiple macroscopic pKas report each macroscopic pKa in a new line.
# Report pKa values to two decimal places (e.g. 10.71).
# Reporting the standard error of the mean (SEM) is optional and encouraged. If it is reported, SEM should be reported to two decimal places (e.g. 1.02).
# For values for which you don't have an estimate, leave that cell of the csv table empty.
#
# The data in each prediction line should be structured as follows:
# Molecule ID, macroscopic pKa, macroscopic pKa SEM
# The list of predictions must begin with the "Predictions:" keyword, as illustrated here.

Method: 
ACD/pKa GALAS algorithm is a multi-step procedure involving estimation of pKa microconstants for all possible ionization centers in a hypothetical state of an uncharged molecule ("fundamental microconstants"), numerous corrections of these initial pKa values according to the surrounding of the reaction center and calculation of charge influences of ionized groups to the neighbouring ionization centers. Calculation routine utilizes a database of 4,600 ionization centers, a set of ca. 500 various interaction constants and four interaction calculation methods for different types of interactions, producing a full range of microconstants from which pKa macroconstants are obtained. This allows for a simulation of complete distribution plot of all protonation states of the molecule at different pH conditions.

The raw calculation results were obtained using ACD/Percepta Kernel API with pKa calculation algorithm set to "GALAS". The raw results were processed with a custom Python script in order to normalize the structures in the provided microstates lists with respect to differences in tautomeric forms and/or resonance structures, match the predicted protonation states with given microstate IDs, and finally, generate the output in the required format.
