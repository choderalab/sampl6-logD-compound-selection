Name:
Linear Regression with B3LYP/6-31G+

Software:
Spartan 14
Gaussian E09

Category:
Mixed

Method:
Molecules are categorized into different classes by considering their structures.
Class I:  SM02, SM09, SM12, and SM13 due to the common N-phenylquinazolin-4-amine group.
Class II: SM04, and SM07 due to the common 4-(benzylamino)quinazoline group.
Class III:  SM14, and SM15 due to the common 1-phenyl-1H-benzoimidazole group.
Class IV: SM08
Class V: SM11
Class VI:  SM16
For each class a substructure search has been carried out  with ZINC15 database and the following pattern has emerged:
"Class I-15 substructures ; Class II-14 substructures; Class III-12 substructures"
"Class IV-6 substructures; Class V-7 substructures; Class VI -12 substructures"
The LogP data of  the SMX molecules in each class and their similar substructures are collected based on ZINC15 database.The same set of molecules have been optimized with B3LYP/6-31G+.
The descriptors considered are the following:

The energy of the HOMO (EHOMO, au)
The energy of  the LUMO (ELUMO, au)

The mean molecular polarizability (a,Bohr3)
The molecular volume (Vm, cm3/mol),
The most negative atomic partial charge in the molecule based on NBO (q-NBO, E),
The most positive atomic partial charge on a hydrogen atom based on NBO (qH+NBO, E),
The most negative atomic partial charge in molecule based on Mulliken (q-Mulliken, E),
The most positive atomic partial charge on a hydrogen atom based on Mulliken (qH+Mulliken, E).

These molecular descriptors are used to generate  a multiple linear regression by using the best model in XLSTAT, an Excel plug-in. The molecular descriptors of the substructures of each class have been used to obtain the QSPR equation:

where a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h, i are regression coffiecients, and LogP0 is the y-intercept.
The molecular descriptors of each SMX molecule are inserted in the QSPR equation to obtain predicted  LogP values, these latter values have been reported.
The differences between the predicted and actual LogPZINC15 values are used for calculating the standard error of the mean (SEM) and the root mean square error (RMSE) values.
For the calculation of standard error of the mean (SEM), the standard deviations (?) have been calculated by using Equation 1.

The standard error of mean (SEM) values have been calculated by using Equation 2.
SEM=s/v(Sample Size)   (2)
Finally, the root mean square errors (RMSE) have been used as model uncertainity based on Equation 3 where Pi  is the value of LogPZINC15 for each molecule, Oi is the LogPCalculated and n is the number substructures considered for each data set.
