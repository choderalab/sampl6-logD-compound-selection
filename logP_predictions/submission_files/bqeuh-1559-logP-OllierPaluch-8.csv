Method: 
logP's were computed using a LSER correlation using LSER parameters predicted using
a QSAR model with ISIDA fragments trained on the CompTox database of LSER parameters
from the UFZ-LSER database. The QSAR correllation was performed using the online
tool Chembench. Due to the nature of these calculations,
the reported precision (or standard error of the computed logP) is 0.0. Given the same
initial SMILES, the method will yield the same predictions.

The LSER correlation was trained use multilinear reguression on a training set of 100 molecules with known logP values. 
To create a training set, we used DrugBank.ca.
From the SAMPL6 molecules, it was found that 6 of the molecules had the 4-amino quinzaoline scaffold.
Additionally, all the molecules were also found to have multiple aromatic rings within their structure. From these observations, DrugBank
was used to find molecules with similair properties. The search 4-amino-quinazoline scaffold led to thousands of results.
From these results, the molecules were selected based on various criteria. To begin, the molecule was only considered if experimental log P values were provided.
Additionally, the size and molecular weight were considered to ensure that the selected test moelcules were representative of the SAMPL6 molecules.
Furthermore, special attention was paid to selecting a number of molecules that incorperated halogens and electronegative atoms.
The incorperation of molecules with numerous electronegative atoms was aimed at accounting for the proton accepting and intramolecular electron pulling behavior
of the SAMPL6 molecules. The final training set was composed of 100 molecules.

To estimate the model accuracy of the predicted logP values, we made predictions for a 
test set of 14 molecules with known logP values. The test set was created using
DrugBank.ca. Using the SAMPL6 structures, we performed a similarity search against
``approved'' drugs in the Drug Bank database to identify molecules with a similarity
score greater than 0.5 for which logP values were available. Calculations for the 
test set were identical to the that used for the SAMPL6 set, starting with SMILES provided
by Drug Bank. The RMS error of the predictions was taken to be the model error.

Finally, predictions were made for the SAMPL6 molecules using the provided SMILES.
