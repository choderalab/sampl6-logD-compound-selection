Method:
Alchemical free energy calculations were performed in explicit
solvent, following the protocol described in [1].  We used "dry"
octanol (water content 0 mol %).  Parameters were generated with
Antechamber from AmberTools and ACPYPE for AMBER (GAFF) with the TIP3P
water model. Files were prepared for Gromacs 2018. The alchemical data
were analyzed with thermodynamic integration. Errors are reported as
errors of the mean (see [1]). The model uncertainty was estimated on
the basis of an unpublished data set of 92 compounds for which we
computed errors for solvation free energies in water and octanol.  [1]
