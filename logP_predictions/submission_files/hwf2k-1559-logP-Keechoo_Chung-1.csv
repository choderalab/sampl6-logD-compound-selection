Method: 
logP values of 11 SAMPL6 molecules in the octanol/water partitioning system were established by extended solvent-contact model. 
A potential energy function defined for each solvent with respect to atomic distributions and three kinds of atomic parameters. 
Using the training set consisting of 49 organic molecules with varying shapes and functional groups, atomic parameters were optimized by standard genetic algorithm for each solvent, octanol and water.. 
With these trained atomic parameters, solvation free energies of 11 SAMPL6 molecules could be obtained with respect to octanol/water, and logP values were determined from the difference between the solvation free energy of a molecule in water and that in octanol.
