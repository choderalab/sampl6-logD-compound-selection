Method: 
Dunning’s cc-pVTZ basis set was used for all calculations. The recommended cc-pV(T+d)Z basis set was used for all Cl atoms. 
All structures were optimzied in Gaussian16 with the B3LYP density functional with Grimme’s D3 dispersion correction with Becke-Johnson dampening. 
The B3LYP-D3 functional was chosen since there are numerous conjugated ring structures that may exhibit pi-pi stacking intramolecularly. 
Also, the use of Grimme’s dispersion correction can alter ligand orientation for systems exhibiting long-range noncovalent interactions. 
All structures were verified to be local minima via frequency calculations on an ‘ultrafine’ integration grid with harmonic frequencies and vibrational contributions to the Gibbs free energy were scaled to 0.989 in accordance with previous studies.
Given the size of the challenge molecules and previous studies indicating that the amount of exact exchange within a functional correlates with logP prediction in the SAMPL5 competition, 
the domain-based local pair natural orbital (DLPNO) CCSD(T) method within the ORCA 4.0 program suite was utilized to predict logP. 
The coulomb-exchange fitting correlation consistent auxiliary basis set (cc-pVTZ/JK) was used in conjunction with the RIJCOSX approximation. 
The RIJCOSX approximation is a resolution-of-the-identity approximation that calculates Coulomb integrals and uses a semi-numerical integration technique to calculate the exchange integrals. 
Within ORCA, the TightPNO setting was utilized to reduce the number of screened pair natural orbitals (PNOs) from the DLPNO-CCSD(T) calculation. 
To calculate the logP, the SMD implicit solvent model for water and 1-octanol was used within ORCA 4.0.
LogP was calculated with a vertical solvation method following Eq (1) below
logP = log([solute]octanol/[solute]water) = (\Delta G_water - \Delta G_octanol)*(log10e)/kT (1)
where k is Boltzmann’s constant, T is temperature, e is Euler’s number and \Delta G is the free energy of solvation for each respective solvent.
