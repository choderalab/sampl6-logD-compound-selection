Method:
Alchemical Simulations were run for different tautomers of the small molecules.
13 lambda states were used to subsequently turn off Lennard-Jones interactions and electrostatic interactions in different boxes of solvent and in gas phase. 
Succeeding a short NPT equilibration, molecular dynamics were run in NVT for 5ns in each lambda state using OpenMM. 
Solvation free energies for each tautomer were calculated using MBAR.
The trajectories of fully solvated lambda states were read into CHARMM and energies were recalculated
to make up for differences in the functional form of the potential energy functions, such as the Lennard-Jones switching function.
One-sided free energy reweighting was performed from OpenMM to CHARMM energies.
Partition coefficients were calculated by Boltzmann-weighting over different boxes of solvent and all tautomers for a given solute molecule.
Statistical uncertainties were estimated using 5 blocks of 1 ns each.

Boxes of solvent used in this submission: pure water, pure octanol, water-saturated octanol.

Force field parameters were first generated using CGenFF (paramchem).
Subsequently, partial charges and torsion parameters that had been positive CGenFF penalty values were reparameterized with respect to quantum data using FFTK and lsfitpar.
