Method: 
Dunning’s cc-pVTZ basis set was used for all calculations. The recommended cc-pV(T+d)Z basis set was used for all Cl atoms. 
All calculations were done in Gaussian16. All challenge molecules were optimized with the B3LYP density functional with Grimme’s D3 dispersion correction with Becke-Johnson dampening. 
The B3LYP-D3 functional was chosen since there are numerous conjugated ring structures that may exhibit pi-pi stacking intramolecularly. 
Also, the use of Grimme’s dispersion correction can alter ligand orientation for systems exhibiting long-range noncovalent interactions. 
All structures were verified to be local minima via frequency calculations on an ‘ultrafine’ integration grid with harmonic frequencies and vibrational contributions to the Gibbs free energy were scaled to 0.989 in accordance with previous studies.
Single point DFT calculations with the BLYP functional were done to calculate the logP.
All single point calculations use Solvent Model for Density, or SMD, implicit solvent model to simulate long-range solvent effects of water and 1-octanol on the solute. 
LogP was calculated with a vertical solvation method following Eq (1) below
logP = log([solute]octanol/[solute]water) = (\Delta G_water - \Delta G_octanol)*(log10e)/kT (1)
where k is Boltzmann’s constant, T is temperature, e is Euler’s number and \Delta G is the free energy of solvation for each respective solvent.
