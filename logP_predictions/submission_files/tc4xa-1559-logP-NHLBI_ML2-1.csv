# PARTITION COEFFICIENT PREDICTIONS 
#  
# This file will be automatically parsed. It must contain the following four elements:  
# predictions, name of method, software listing, and method description. 
# These elements must be provided in the order shown with their respective headers. 
# 
# Any line that begins with a # is considered a comment and will be ignored when parsing. 
# 
# PREDICTION SECTION
#
# It is mandatory to submit logP predictions for all 11 molecules. Incomplete submissions will not be accepted.
# Please report logP standard error of the mean (SEM) and logP model uncertainty. 
# The data in each prediction line should be structured as follows:
# Molecule ID, logP, logP SEM, logP model uncertainty
# The list of predictions must begin with the 'Predictions:' keyword as illustrated here.

# All text following the 'Method:' keyword will be regarded as part of your free text methods description. 
Method:
We built a deep neural network model to predict log P values. 
The input vector contains consists of a 1024 size bit vector of Morgan Fingerprints.
The dense NN contains 5 hidden layers with 3X 512 and 2X 256 .
Input training data was obtained from Popova et.al.(Science Advances  25 Jul 2018:Vol. 4, no. 7, eaap7885 DOI: 10.1126/sciadv.aap7885) 
5-fold cross validation was performed on the training data.
