Method:
"Partition coefficient (log P) were estimated from the difference in solvation free energies of solute in neutral state in water and 1-octanol at infinite dilution."
"For hydration, a simulation box size of 32 A was used (~1100 water molecules), while for solvation in 1-octanol we used 40 A preequilibrated box of water saturated (""wet"")  octanol containing  240 1-octanol molecules and 83 water molecules."
"200ns MD run was used to preequilibrate octanol boxe followed by 10 ns Temperature Replica Exchange runs with 20 temperature replicas with maximal temperature of 600K."
"Solute, Water, and 1-octanol were treated based on General Amber Force Field implemented in our inhouse Arbalest software."
"GAFF parameters for solute molecules and octanol-1 molecules have been set using ACPYPE python interface ( BMC Research Notes, 2012, 5:367 ) to ANTECHAMBER utilility in AMBERTOOLS (Wang, J., Wang, W., Kollman P. A.; Case, D. A. ""Automatic atom type and bond type perception in molecular mechanical calculations"". Journal of Molecular Graphics and Modelling , 25, 2006, 247260.). "
"GAFF Atom charges have been set using AM1-BCC procedure."
"In-house tools in the Arbalest code and various scripts in Octave/Matlab were used for setting up the initial configuration and subsequent post processing of generated data. Solvation free energy calculations were broken into 12 lambda states, while annihilation was done for all interactions in similar way as it was done for protein-ligand complexes (as in PNAS (2008) 105:10378)."
"Isothermal-isobaric ensemble based molecular dynamics simulations were performed using the Nose-Hoover thermostat at T = 298 K with six chains, a time constant of 1.0 ps, and also a Berendsen barostat at 1 atm reference pressure with a time constant for relaxation of 0.5 ps"
"Each hydration system was simulated separately at each lambda value by minimizing in Arbalest with the steepest descents algorithm, followed by a 5 ns production phase of which we typically discarded starting 1 ns as equilibration."
"Each system system in octanol was simulated separately at each lambda value with a 20 ns production phase at each lambda value of which we typically discarded the first 2 ns."
"Analysis was done with in house Octave/Matlab scripts based on thermodynamic integration using cubic-spline interpolation of the lambda points and BAR, and were used to obtain the solvation free energies (and hence predicted  partition coefficients) reported are based on BAR free energies."
