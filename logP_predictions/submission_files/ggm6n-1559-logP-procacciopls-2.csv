Method: All simulations were performed with the ORAC6.1 molecular
dynamics program using the unidirectional fast switching growth method
(FSGM) (doi: 10.1021/ct500142c). In FSGM, for both w and o solvent,
only the compound configurations at full decoupling (lambda=0,
gas-phase) are canonically sampled using Hamiltonian Replica Exchange
with Torsional Tempering (HREM-TT) (doi: 10.1002/jcc.21388). Gas-phase
HREM-TT (8 ns on the target state and eight replicas with min. scaling
factor of 0.1 [ 3000 K] on a single molecule in an empty box ) are
done by scaling along the replica progression only the torsional
potentials (including the 14 non bonded interactions) of the atoms
connecting the phenyl and quinazoline moieties. The starting
configurations at lambda=0 (no coupling) for the fast growth (NE)
process are prepared by combining 440 gas-phase H-REM sampled
configurations with few snapshots taken from NPT equilibrated runs of
pure solvents. In water and in 1-octanol the FNE alchemical switch-on
(fast growth) time was 150 and 300 ps, respectively.  The solvation
free energies are recovered from the collection of the growth work
values using either the Gaussian approximation if the NE work
histogram passed the Anderson Darling (AD) test for normality or the
bear Expectation Maximization estimate for Gaussian mixtures ( see doi:
10.1007/s10822-018-0151-9 ) in case of failure of the AD test. Error
(95% confidence interval) is computed using bootstrap with resampling
from the FNE work distributions. The simulations in the FNE stages
were performed under Periodic Boundary Conditions (mean box size 40
nm^3 circa in all cases) in the NPT ensemble (standard conditions,
Parrinello Rahman isotropic stress, Nose' thermostats ) using
PME-Ewald (alpha=0.37 and 1 Angs grid spacing in the direct space) and
a LJ cut off of 1.3 nm.

The force field for this prediction is OPLS-AA (Optimized Potentials
for Liquid Simulations, 2017 version (DOI: 10.1021/acs.jpcb.7b00272 )
). Atomic charges were of the type 1.14*CM1A-LBCC.  The FF parameters
(bonded, charges and LJ) and topology of the host and guests molecules
were prepared using the LigParGen web interface ( doi:
10.1093/nar/gkx312). All amino groups were assumed to be
deprotonated. The water model is OPC3 ( doi: 10.1063/1.4960175.).
1-octanol parameterization was done with LigParGen.

Because of the greatly reduced time for the HREM-TT gas phase
sampling, unidirectional FSGM allows to obtain very rapid estimates of
the LogP with 90% of cost due to the NE stage only (90 ns on a per compound
basis). FSGM can screen for LogP 7000 compounds per wall clock day on a
medium size dedicated HPC platfrom, as the Tier-1 CRESCO6/ENEA cluster
in Portici (Italy), equipped with 454 Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU E5-2697 v4
2.30GHz 48-cores processors.
