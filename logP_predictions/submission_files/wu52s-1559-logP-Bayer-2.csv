# This file will be automatically parsed. It must contain the following four elements: 
# predictions, name of method, software listing, and method description. 
# These elements must be provided in the order shown with their respective headers.
#
# Any line that begins with a # is considered a comment and will be ignored when parsing.

# PREDICTION SECTION
#
# It is mandatory to submit logP predictions for all 11 molecules. Incomplete submissions will not be accepted.
# Please report logP standard error of the mean (SEM) and logP model uncertainty. 
# The data in each prediction line should be structured as follows:
# Molecule ID, logP, logP SEM, logP model uncertainty
# The list of predictions must begin with the 'Predictions:' keyword as illustrated here.

Method:
About 78,000 compounds from the Bayer in house assay for logD at pH7.5 were collected and standardized. The compounds were split into three sets for neutral, positively charged and acidic/zwitterionic compounds. From each set 10% of the data was put aside as independent test sets, and the other data used for model-training  (method and descriptor selection, CV-runs). The final PLS model using ECFC-4 fingerprints was trained using all data. It consists of three models for the three charge-state groups. The output corresponding to LogD is given as a logP estimate. The method is deterministic therefore SEM is given as 0 for all compounds.  The uncertainty is given as the validation RMSE (in log units) as a weighted mean of the three submodels.
