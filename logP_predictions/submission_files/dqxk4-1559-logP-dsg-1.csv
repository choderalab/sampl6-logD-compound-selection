Method:
Initial 3D geometries were generated from isomeric SMILES with a KNIME pipeline consisting of the OpenBabel node for initial 2D structure generation and the RDKit 3D coordinate generation and geometry optimisation nodes. Orca 4.1.1 was used to implement all Density Functional Theory calculations in this project. The M06L functional with the D3zero dispersion correction was used for all gas phase geometry optimisations with 1.0e-09 au energy change SCF convergence criteria. Water and octanol free energies of solvation were calculated using the continuum solvation model based on density (SMD) and the M06-2X functional with D3zero dispersion correction. The Def2-SVP basis set was used for density functional approximation calculations in this project. Two replicates of this methodology were implemented on the provided 11-molecule dataset to quantify the standard error of the mean for each chemical prediction. Model uncertainty was quantified using the current methodology to calculate the root mean squared error for the partition coefficients of a 12-chemical subset from the OECD Guidelines for Test No. 117: Partition Coefficient (n-octanol/water), HPLC method (doi: https://doi.org/10.1787/9789264069824-en), selected on the criteria of featuring i) nitrogen atoms, ii) no charge, iii) aromaticity.
