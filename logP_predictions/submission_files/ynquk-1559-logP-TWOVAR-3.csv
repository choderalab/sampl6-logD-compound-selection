Method: 
logP are calculated based on empirical predictions of solvation free energies.
Solvation free energies are predicted based on a linear model that depends on
atomic solvation parameters (based on atom types) and on surface areas:
dGsol = sum(SA[i] * ASP[i]), where
i = atom index
SA = surface area
ASP = atomic solvation parameter.
Then, logP = (dGsol_oct - dGsol_wat) / (-2.303 * RT)
where K = -2.303*RT, T = 293
For water solvation, a total of ~60 atom types were derived based
on B3LYP/cc-pVDZ interaction energies between a chemical group of interest
and a second molecule (hydrogen cyanide). Interaction energies were calculated
for molecules capable of hydrogen bonding (HB) interactions, creating a scale
of HB strengths for various donor and acceptor groups.
SMARTS strings were manually devised to associate the observed HB
strengths to the ~60 atom types.
The model was calibrated using experimental hydration free energies from the
FreeSolv database.
A total of 2 coefficients were fitted by linear regression (lasso) to
re-scale the HB strenghts: one for donors and one for acceptors.
Thus, the ASP of a given atom type is the product of the HB strength by the
corresponding fitted coefficient:
ASP[i] = HB_strength[i] * coef
For predicting the solvation free energy in octanol, the solvent excluded
surface area of the molecule was multiplied by a constant: -0.036 kcal/mol/A^2.
This is an empirical model for estimating solvation free
energies in cyclohexane [dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10822-016-9951-y].  
Since octanol is more polar than cyclohexane, the partition of polar compounds
in octanol is likely underestimated by this model.
Technical details:
Coordinates were generated using OpenBabel.
Surface areas were calculated with MSMS.
B3LYP interaction energies were calculated with Gaussian 09.
