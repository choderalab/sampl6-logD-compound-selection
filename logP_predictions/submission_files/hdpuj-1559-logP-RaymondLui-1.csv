Method:
RayLogP-II is a cheminformatic QSPR model predicting the octanol/water partition coefficient, logP. The model is trained on a 14,045-chemical dataset with experimentally measured or estimated logP values curated by Mansouri et al.(2018, JCheminform 10:10) from the PHYSPROP database (SRC Inc., North Syracuse, NY, USA). The training set ranged approximately 17 log units from logP -5.08 to 11.29, with mean and median logP 2.08 and 2.00, respectively. The training molecules were formatted in simplified molecular-input line-entry system (SMILES) nomenclature. Chemical structural curation was performed in ChemAxon Standardizer 18.13.0 (ChemAxon, Budapest, Hungary): metal atoms, salts, and solvents were removed, remaining charged fragments neutralized, explicit hydrogens added, and the two-dimensional coordinates of new or changed atoms recalculated. A set of 1,438 1- and 2-dimensional physicochemical descriptors were generated for each training molecule using PaDEL Descriptor 2.21 (Yap, 2011, J Comput Chem 57:36-49). Descriptors involving the direct calculation of logP were excluded from the final representation to avoid information leakage when predicting logP. A multilinear regression algorithm was employed to model QSPRs between the descriptors and logP. Stochastic gradient descent was implemented to update coefficient weights of the regression line in order to minimise a squared epsilon insensitive loss function. The optimisation followed an inversely scaled 'simulated annealing' schedule, gradually lowering the learning rate at which the weights are updated. The model was implemented in Scikit-Learn 0.19.1 (Pedregosa et al., 2011, J Mach Learn Res 12:2825-2830) for Python 3.6.6. To validate RayLogP-II, a hold-out external validation strategy was adopted, as described by Esbensen and Geladi (2010, JChemom 24:168-187). A 707-chemical dataset with logP values experimentally measured by Martel et al. (2013, Eur J Pharm Sci 48:21-29) using UHPLC-UV/MS was exclusively held from the training process to appropriately test the prediction generalisability of RayLogP-II on unseen real-world chemicals. Regression model performance was quantified by root mean square error (RMSE) between the predicted logP values and the benchmark logP values provided by Martel et al. (2013). RayLogP achieved a RMSE of 0.97 on the Martel dataset. In comparison, the well-established XLogP calculation method achieved a RMSE of 1.37 on the Martel dataset. The model uncertainty of RayLogP-II was evaluated using a set of 60 reference substances recommended by the OECD Guidelines For The Testing Of Chemicals, Test No. 117: Partition Coefficient (n-octanol/water), HPLC Method (Table 1). RayLogP-II achieved a RMSE of 0.50 between its predicted values and the reference values of the OECD-recommended chemicals. This is used as a global measure of model uncertainty in the above predictions. When predicting the logP of each of the 11 SAMPL6 molecules, 5 repetitions were performed by using 5 different random states (i.e. the seeds  to the random number generator) used by the multilinear regression algorithm. The 5 logP predictions for each molecule were averaged, and the standard error of the mean calculated. The averaged logP values and their SEM (statistical uncertainty) are reported in the above predictions.
