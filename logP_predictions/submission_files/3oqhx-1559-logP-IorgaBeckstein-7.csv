Method:
Alchemical free energy calculations were performed in explicit
solvent, following the protocol described in [1].  We used "dry"
octanol (water content 0 mol %).  Parameters were generated with  the
PARAMCHEM CGENFF program via the server at
https://cgenff.umaryland.edu/ for CHARMM/CGenFF with the CHARMM TIP3P
water model. Note that the latest version of CGENFF produces lone
pairs, which are not yet supported in the conversion scripts from
CHARMM to Gromacs and a prediction of 0+/-10 is provided for these
cases.. Files were prepared for Gromacs 2018. The alchemical data were
analyzed with thermodynamic integration. Errors are reported as errors
of the mean (see [1]). The model uncertainty was estimated on the
basis of an unpublished data set of 92 compounds for which we computed
errors for solvation free energies in water and octanol.  [1] I. M.
