Name:
Solvation-B3LYP
Software:
Gaussian 09 E.01
Category:
Physical
Method:
All the quantum chemical calculations were performed using Gaussian 09 E.01 software package.  All the structures belonging to stationary points were optimized by the means of density functional theory (DFT) by using the B3LYP functional and the 6-311+G(d,p) basis set. A conformational search was performed manually since all of the molecules were planar. The optimizations for all the conformations were conducted in water (e=78.36) and n-octanol (e=10.30)  environment using the Solvation Model based on Density (SMD) method at 298K. Equation 1 was used to calculate the Log P value of the molecules. Log P values of all conformers were calculated. The average of the Log P values of the conformers was reported as Log P value for each molecule.


Equation 1. Log P (Kow) equation used

For the calculation of standard error of mean (SEM), standard deviations (?) were calculated according to the Equation 2.



Equation 2. Standard deviation equation

After calculation of standard deviations, standard error of mean (SEM) values were calculated according to the Equation 3.

SEM=s/v(Sample Size)

Equation 3. SEM equation

Finally, root mean square errors (RMSE) were investigated as model uncertainity according to the Equation 4 where Pi  is the value of average Log P for each molecule, Oi is the Log P value for each conformer and n is the number of conformers for each molecule. (Table 1)




Equation 4. RMSE equation
