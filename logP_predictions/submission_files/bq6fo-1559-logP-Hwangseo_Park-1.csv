Method: 
  The 3D-QSAR prediction model termed AlphaQ was optimized to estimate the LogP values of 11 SAMPL6 molecules
using those of 40 well-known molecules as the training set.
  To generate the optimal atomic coordinates,
3D structural alignments were conducted for all the training-set and SAMPL6 molecules
in such a way to maximize the quantum mechanical cross correlations among the molecules.
  3D distribution of the molecular electrostatic potential was used as the unique numerical descriptor for individual molecules.
  The artificial neural network algorithm was then applied to derive the LogP prediction model for 11 SAMPL6 molecules.
