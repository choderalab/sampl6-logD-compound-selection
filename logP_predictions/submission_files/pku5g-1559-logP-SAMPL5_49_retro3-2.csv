Method: 
Predictions were calculated using a similar approach as for submission 49 in SAMPL5,
in which one of the atom types (aromic nitrogen, non-HB acceptor) was excluded from
the model. This is referred to as retrospective experiment 3 in [dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10822-016-9951-y].
Predicted values are based on the (predicted) free energy of solvation in water (solG_wat)
and cyclohexane (solG_chex).
Since octanol is more polar than cyclohexane,
the partition of polar compounds in water is likely overestimated.
Prediction of solG_wat values consisted in a linear regression model
using the solvent excluded surface (SES) area of each atom type. A total
of 8 atom types were used (one atom type was excluded).
MSMS was used to calculate SES areas, with a probe
radius of 1.5 angstroms. The sum of absolute atomic partial charges
multiplied by the SES area of the corresponding atom, was also included as
an explanatory variable. OpenBabel was used to calculate partial charges.
The FreeSolv-0.32 database was used to build this model.
The linear model for solG_chex only used a single explanatory variable,
the SES area of the molecule. The same probe radius was used (1.5 A).
This model was built on data from doi:10.1002/jcc.10052
LogD values were calculated using the following formula:
    logP = (solG_chex - solG_wat) / K
where K = -2.303*RT, T = 293
3D coordinates were generated using OpenBabel, ignoring possible changes in
protonation states and conformation.
