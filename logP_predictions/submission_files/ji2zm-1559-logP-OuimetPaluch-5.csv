Method: 
logP's were computed using a multiple linear regression trained on a training set composed of 
99 molecules with known logP values. The solute descriptors were the computed dimensionless solvation free energy
of the solute in water and 1-octanol at infinite dilution at 298 K and 1 bar
computed using the SM8 solvation model as implemented in Q-Chem.

To create a training set, we used DrugBank.ca. 
From the SAMPL6 molecules, it was found that 6 of the molecules had the 4-amino quinzaoline scaffold.
Additionally, all the molecules were also found to have multiple aromatic rings within their structure. From these observations, DrugBank
was used to find molecules with similair properties. The search 4-amino-quinazoline scaffold led to thousands of results.
From these results, the molecules were selected based on various criteria. To begin, the molecule was only considered if experimental log P values were provided.
Additionally, the size and molecular weight were considered to ensure that the selected test moelcules were representative of the SAMPL6 molecules.
Furthermore, special attention was paid to selecting a number of molecules that incorperated halogens and electronegative atoms.
The incorperation of molecules with numerous electronegative atoms was aimed at accounting for the proton accepting and intramolecular electron pulling behavior 
of the SAMPL6 molecules. The final training set was composed of 99 molecules.

Starting with the provided SMILES from DrugBank, 3-D structures were generated using Open Babel and the
General Amber Force Field (GAFF). We performed a systematic conformation search to predict
the lowest energy conformer. The geometry was then optimized at the M06-2X/cc-pVDZ level of
theory/basis set. This vacuum optimized geometry was then used to compute the solvation
free energy in water and 1-octanol at the M06-2X/6-31G(d) level of theory/basis set with
the SM12 solvation model. All of the electronic structure calculations were performed with
Q-Chem.

We then performed a multiple linear regression of the form 
   logP = c1 +c2*dGwater-c3dGoctanol
where c1, c2, and c3 are constants, and dGwater and dGoctanol are the 
dimensionless solvation free energy in water and octanol.

Due to the nature of these calculations, the reported precision (or standard error of the computed
logP) is 0.0. Provided the same initial geometry and using the same electronic structure calculation
theory/basis set (with the same software), one should compute the same solvation free energy.
If the initial geometry or charge protonation state were to change, we would expect the
computed values to change. This, however, is beyond the scope of this study.

To estimate the model accuracy of the predicted logP values, we made predictions for a 
test set of 14 molecules with known logP values. The test set was created again using
DrugBank.ca. Using the SAMPL6 structures, we performed a similarity search against
``approved'' drugs in the Drug Bank database to identify molecules with a similarity
score greater than 0.5 for which logP values were available. Calculations for the 
test set were identical to that used for the training set set. The module accuracy was
taken to be the RMS error of the predictions.

Finally, predictions were made with the SAMPL6 molecules in an identical fashion.
