# PARTITION COEFFICIENT PREDICTIONS
# 
# This file will be automatically parsed. It must contain the following four elements: 
# predictions, name of method, software listing, and method description. 
# These elements must be provided in the order shown with their respective headers.
#
# Any line that begins with a # is considered a comment and will be ignored when parsing.
#
# PREDICTION SECTION
#
# It is mandatory to submit logP predictions for all 11 molecules. Incomplete submissions will not be accepted.
# Please report logP standard error of the mean (SEM) and logP model uncertainty. 
# The data in each prediction line should be structured as follows:
# Molecule ID, logP, logP SEM, logP model uncertainty
# The list of predictions must begin with the 'Predictions:' keyword as illustrated here. 
Predictions:
SM02, 2.00, 2.00, 0.5
SM04, 2.00, 2.00, 0.5
SM07, 3.00, 1.00, 0.5
SM08, 4.00, 3.00, 0.5
SM09, 1.00, 5.00, 0.5
SM11, 3.00, 5.00, 0.5
SM12, 6.00, 1.00, 0.5
SM13, 3.00, 2.00, 0.5
SM14, 1.00, 1.00, 0.5
SM15, 2.00, 5.00, 0.5
SM16, 4.00, 5.00, 0.5


# NAME SECTION
#
# Please provide an informal but informative name of the method used. 
# The 'Name:' keyword is required as shown here.
Name:
dice


# SOFTWARE SECTION
#
# List all major software packages used and their versions.
# Create a new line for each software.
# The 'Software:' keyword is required.
Software: 
--



# METHOD CATEGORY SECTION
#
# State which method category your prediction method is better described as:
# `Physical`, `Empirical`, `Mixed`, or `Other`.
# Pick only one category label.
# The `Category:` keyword is required.
Category:
Mixed


# METHOD DESCRIPTION SECTION
#
# Methodology and computational details.
# Level of details should be roughly equivalent to that used in a publication.
# Please include the values of key parameters with units. Please explain how statistical uncertainties were estimated.
# Use as many lines of text as you need.
# All text following the 'Method:' keyword will be regarded as part of your free text methods description.
Method:
We roll dice. 
Statistical uncertainties were also estimated using dice. 
Model uncertainty is clearly 0.5: An inhererent feature of our method is that predictions are integers between 1 and 6.
(These are easy to digest and can be stored efficiently -- also the submission template is kind of wasteful, because of the requested precision.)
The method uses minimal computational resources and all tools are available to the community.
Preliminary analyses were performed using alternative techniques.
These preliminary results suggested that a range of [1,6] is reasonable, which ensures the principal feasibility of the dice method.
The present work is directly transferable to many other hydrophobic molecules. 
Extensions to hydrophilic substances will be discussed elsewhere.
