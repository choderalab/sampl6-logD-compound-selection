ZINC15 versus PM3

Software:
Spartan 14

Category:
Mixed

Method:
Molecules are categorized into different classes by their scructures.
Class I:  SM02, SM09, SM12, and SM13 due to the common N-phenylquinazolin-4-amine group.
"Class II: SM04, and SM07"" due to the common 4-(benzylamino)quinazoline group."
Class III:  SM14, and SM15 due to the common 1-phenyl-1H-benzoimidazole group.
Class IV: SM08
Class V: SM11
Class VI:  SM16
For each class a substructure search has been carried out  with ZINC15 database and the following pattern has emerged:
"Class I-15 substructures ; Class II-14 substructures; Class III-12 substructures"
"Class IV-6 substructures; Class V-7 substructures; Class VI -12 substructures"
The LogP data of SMX molecules and their substructures  are collected based on ZINC15 database.The same set of molecules has been optimized with PM3 and their corresonding log P values have been evaluated with PM3 in Spartan.
LogPZINC15 versus LogPPM3 graph is plotted. The equation obtained from the trendline is used by feeding LogPPM3 value to predict a LogPZINC15 value of SMX molecules and their similar substructures. The Difference between the predicted and actual LogPZINC15 are used for calculating the standard error of the mean (SEM) and uncertainty(RMSE) values.
For the calculation of standard error of mean (SEM), standard deviations (?) were calculated according to the Equation 1.


Equation 1. Standard deviation equation
After calculation of standard deviations, standard error of mean (SEM) values were calculated according to the Equation 2.
SEM=s/v(Sample Size)

Equation 2. SEM equation
Finally, root mean square errors (RMSE) were investigated as model uncertainity according to the Equation 3 where Pi  is the value of LogPZINC15 for each molecule, Oi is the LogPCalculated and n is the number substructures considered for each dataset.


Equation 3. RMSE equation
