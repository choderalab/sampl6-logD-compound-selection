Method:
We run water simulations of the molecule and extract energy components to construct a feature vector (termed molecular dynamics fingerprint). By collecting feature vectors from a set of molecules with known logP values, we can train machine learning (ML) models to infer the relationship between the energy components and experimental observation.

The detailed workflow has been described in this previous publication:`10.1021/acs.jcim.6b00778`. The difference here is instead of using GAFF-like parameters in the GROMOS simulation package, here molecules are parameterised via Openforcefield and ran with OpenMM.

The key difference of this submission to other submissions by the same authors is: a single ML model is trained to map the feature vectors to logP readings. This logP model is trained from a set of 15,784 molecules.

The standard error of mean (SEM) is estimated by repeating the prediction model 100 times with different random seed for the learning models. The overall model uncertainty is estimated by performing a 100-fold cross-validation on the logP dataset and looking at the overall MAE.
