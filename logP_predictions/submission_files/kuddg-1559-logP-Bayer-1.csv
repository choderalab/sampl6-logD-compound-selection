# PREDICTION SECTION
#
# It is mandatory to submit logP predictions for all 11 molecules. Incomplete submissions will not be accepted.
# Please report logP standard error of the mean (SEM) and logP model uncertainty. 
# The data in each prediction line should be structured as follows:
# Molecule ID, logP, logP SEM, logP model uncertainty
# The list of predictions must begin with the 'Predictions:' keyword as illustrated here.

Method:
Around half a million compounds from 10 physico-chemical in house assays (including logD at pH7.5 and logD at pH2.3) were collected and standardized. A multitask graph convolution network was trained to simultaneously predict those 10 assays.
The architecture of the network consists of 2 convolutions followed by a fully connected layer of 256 neurons. The input size for the atom descriptor was 75. The architecture was taken 
following the ADMET example from DeepChem. The 11 compounds from SAMPL6 were pre-processed similarly to the training set and passed through the multitask model. The output corresponding to LogD is given as a logP estimate. The method is deterministic therefore SEM is given as 0 for all compounds. The uncertainty is given as the validation RMSE (in log units) in a cluster-split setting where compounds that belong to a given chemical cluster are set out as test set (and excluded from training). Therefore a higher number corresponds to a higher uncertainty.
