# PARTITION COEFFICIENT PREDICTIONS
# 
# This file will be automatically parsed. It must contain the following four elements: 
# predictions, name of method, software listing, and method description. 
# These elements must be provided in the order shown with their respective headers.
#
# Any line that begins with a # is considered a comment and will be ignored when parsing.
#
# PREDICTION SECTION
#
# It is mandatory to submit logP predictions for all 11 molecules. Incomplete submissions will not be accepted.
# Please report logP standard error of the mean (SEM) and logP model uncertainty. 
# The data in each prediction line should be structured as follows:
# Molecule ID, logP, logP SEM, logP model uncertainty
# The list of predictions must begin with the 'Predictions:' keyword as illustrated here. 
Predictions:
SM02,4.03,0.31,0.31
SM04,3.73,0.32,0.31
SM07,3.09,0.29,0.31
SM08,2.53,0.46,0.31
SM09,3.27,0.29,0.31
SM11,1.21,0.36,0.31
SM12,3.82,0.33,0.31
SM13,3.57,0.23,0.31
SM14,2.12,0.23,0.31
SM15,2.27,0.4,0.31
SM16,3.32,0.29,0.31

# NAME SECTION
#
# Please provide an informal but informative name of the method used. 
# The 'Name:' keyword is required as shown here.
Name:
S+logP

# SOFTWARE SECTION
#
# List all major software packages used and their versions.
# Create a new line for each software.
# The 'Software:' keyword is required.
Software:
ADMET Predictor 9.5, Simulations Plus, Inc., 2018, https://www.simulations-plus.com/software/admetpredictor/

# METHOD CATEGORY SECTION
#
# State which method category your prediction method is better described as:
# `Physical`, `Empirical`, `Mixed`, or `Other`.
# Pick only one category label.
# The `Category:` keyword is required.
Category:
Empirical

# METHOD DESCRIPTION SECTION
#
# Methodology and computational details.
# Level of details should be roughly equivalent to that used in a publication.
# Please include the values of key parameters with units. Please explain how statistical uncertainties were estimated.
# Use as many lines of text as you need.
# All text following the 'Method:' keyword will be regarded as part of your free text methods description.
Method:
S+logP in an artificial neural network ensemble (ANNE) model built by ADMET Modeler software in 2013.
The logP SEM column contains estimated individual prediction errors determined by Simulations Plus' new algorithm to be published in a future version of ADMET Predictor
The  uncertainty column contains model's global RMSE determined on the test subset counting 1759 compounds.
S+logP details are contained in the following webinar: https://www.simulations-plus.com/assets/SimPlusWebinar06.28.13-PchemBio.mp4
ADMET Modeler is described in https://www.simulations-plus.com/software/admetpredictor/admet-modeler/
