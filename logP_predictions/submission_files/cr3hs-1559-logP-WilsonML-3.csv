Method:
A QSAR/Quantum Mechanics/Machine Learning-based approach was used to predict the logP coefficients of the 11 SAMPL6 challenge molecules.  
First, 97 molecules were selected from NIST’s list of logP values.  Their structures were derived and geometries were optimized. ,
Descriptors used include 
"Polarizability','apol','ASA_H','a_hyd','GCUT_SMR_3','mr','vdw_vol','vsa_hyd'"

A Partial Least Squares model with 3 components was derived from three descriptors that captured roughly 77% of the variance in the training set and had an RMSE of 0.50 and an RMSECV of 0.69.  
This model was applied to the challenge molecules, yielding logP predictions ranging from -1.52 - 4.37.


"Data Selection"
A total of 97 molecules were selected from NIST’s list of partition coefficients.  The molecules were hand-chosen based on their structural similarity to the challenge set molecules.  
Multiple types of molecules, including aromatic rings, heterocyclic rings, ketones, esters, ethers, alcohols, and molecules containing N, O ,F, and Cl were chosen.  
For each molecule selected from NIST’s list, the corresponding recommended logP coefficient was also stored.,
SMILES strings were retrieved using PubChem, and were transformed into 3-dimensional coordinates via Open Babel.
Most descriptors were generated from quantum mechanical calculations, described below.,

"QM Methodology"
Structures were optimized with the B3LYP functional with Grimme's D3 dispersion correction with Becke-Johnson dampening and Dunning's cc-pVTZ basis set.
QM-generated QSAR descriptors were obtained with single point calculations with the PBE and PBE0 functionals with the cc-pVTZ basis set. The SMD implicit solvent model was used to simulate the effects of water and octanol.
All QM calculations were done in Gaussian16.

The trained model was then applied against the challenge set to derive our logP values.
