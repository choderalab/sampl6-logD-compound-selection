Method: All simulations were performed with the ORAC6.1 molecular
dynamics program using the bidirectional fast switching
annihilation/growth method (FSAGM) (doi: 10.1021/ct500142c). In FSAGM,
for both w and o solvent, configurations at full coupling (lambda=1)
and full decoupling (lambda=0) are canonically sampled using
Hamiltonian Replica Exchange with Torsional Tempering (HREM-TT) (doi:
10.1002/jcc.21388). HREM-TT (8 ns on the target state and eight
replicas with min. scaling factor of 0.1 [ 3000 K] ) are done by
scaling along the replica progression only the torsional potentials
(including the 14 non bonded interactions) of the atoms connecting the
phenyl and quinazoline moieties. Starting from the canonical
configurations sampled at lambda=1 and lambda=0, few hundreds (440) of
fast non equilibrium simulation (FNE) are launched where the
solute-solvent interactions are continuously switched off and switched
on (with inverted time schedule), respectively. In water and in
1-octanol the FNE alchemical switch-on/off time was 150 and 300 ps,
respectively.  The solvation free energies are recovered from the
collection of annihilation and growth work values using the Bennett
Acceptance Ratio estimate. Error is computed using bootstrap with
resampling from the FNE work distributions. All simulations, in both
HREM-TT and FNE stages, were performed under Periodic Boundary
Conditions (mean box size 40 nm^3 circa in all cases) in the NPT
ensemble (standard conditions, Parrinello Rahman isotropic stress,
Nose' thermostats ) using PME-Ewald (alpha=0.37 and 1 Angs grid
spacing in the direct space) and a LJ cut off of 1.3 nm.

The force field for this prediction is GAFF2 (generalized Amber Force
Field, version 2, www.amber.org ).  The FF parameters (bonded, charges
and LJ) and topology of the host and guests molecules were prepared
using the PrimaDORAC interface ( doi: 10.1021/acs.jcim.7b00145). All
amino groups were assumed to be deprotonated. The water model is OPC3
( doi: 10.1063/1.4960175.). 1-octanol parameterization was done with
PrimaDORAC.

On a per solute basis, the cost (expressed in ns of simulation needed)
of the HREM-TT was 128 ns and that of NE stage 180 ns.
