# PREDICTION SECTION
#
# It is mandatory to submit logP predictions for all 11 molecules. Incomplete submissions will not be accepted.
# Please report logP standard error of the mean (SEM) and logP model uncertainty. 
# The data in each prediction line should be structured as follows:
# Molecule ID, logP, logP SEM, logP model uncertainty
# The list of predictions must begin with the 'Predictions:' keyword as illustrated here.

Method:
The IEFPCM/MST method is a quantum mechanical (QM) self-consistent continuum solvation method that have proved to be a cost-effective approach for the calculation of solvation free energies in differents solvents. From the computation of the solvation free energies in water and n-octanol the partition coefficient is determined. In the Miertus−Scrocco−Tomasi model, the solvation free energy is calculated by adding nonelectrostatic and electrostatic contributions, which are calculated using a double molecule-shaped cavity for the solute embedded in the polarizable continuum medium.
