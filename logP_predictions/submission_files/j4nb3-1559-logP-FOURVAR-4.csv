Method: 
logP are calculated based on empirical predictions of solvation free energies.
Solvation free energies are predicted based on a linear model that depends on
atomic solvation parameters (based on atom types) and on surface areas:
dGsol = sum(SA[i] * ASP[i]), where
i = atom index
SA = surface area
ASP = atomic solvation parameter.
Then, logP = (dGsol_oct - dGsol_wat) / (-2.303 * RT)
where K = -2.303*RT, T = 293
For water solvation, a total of ~60 atom types were derived based
on B3LYP/cc-pVDZ interaction energies between a chemical group of interest
and a second molecule (hydrogen cyanide). Interaction energies were calculated
for molecules capable of hydrogen bonding (HB) interactions, creating a scale
of HB strengths for various donor and acceptor groups.
SMARTS strings were manually devised to associate the observed HB
strengths to the ~60 atom types.
The model was calibrated using experimental hydration free energies from the
FreeSolv database.
A total of 4 coefficients were fitted by linear regression (lasso) to
re-scale the HB strenghts: two for donors and two for acceptors.
Thus, the ASP of a given atom type is the product of the HB strength by the
corresponding fitted coefficient and intercept:
ASP[i] = HB_strength[i] * coef + intercept
There is a total of 4 optimizated variables: coef for donors, coef for
acceptors, intercept for donors and intercept for acceptors.
For predicting the solvation free energy in octanol, the solvent excluded
surface area of the molecule was multiplied by a constant: -0.036 kcal/mol/A^2.
This is an empirical model for estimating solvation free
energies in cyclohexane [dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10822-016-9951-y].  
Since octanol is more polar than cyclohexane, the partition of polar compounds
in octanol is likely underestimated by this model.
Technical details:
Coordinates were generated using OpenBabel.
Surface areas were calculated with MSMS.
B3LYP interaction energies were calculated with Gaussian 09.
