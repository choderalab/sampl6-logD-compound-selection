Method: 
We applied a QSAR based approach to predict logp for 11 compounds using molecular descriptors including physicochemical properties and fingerprints. 
We built a model using random forest with recursive feature selection.
To build a model we trained 701 chemical compounds obtained from a paper(https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejps.2012.10.019).
Since we calculated large number of molecular features (p=7471), we recursively selected molecular features while building random forest models with given number of iterations(n=100 iterations). We selected important feature correlating to logp based on feature importances in random forest model.
