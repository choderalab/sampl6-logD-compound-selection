Method:
A number of geometries per microstate was generated using Maestro 2017-2/Macromodel with the OPLS3/Water force field with mixed torsional/low-mode sampling, 100 steps per RB and 1000 steps max (default parameters).
The resulting conformations were optimized using Gaussian 16revB01 with IEF-PCM using default settings for water or n-octanol respectively at the B3LYP/6-311+G(d,p) level of theory.
These conformations were treated with EC-RISM/MP2/6-311+G(d,p) using the PSE2 closure for water and the PSE1 closure for n-octanol [REF1] and the resulting free energies of solvation reparametrized with respect to the MNSol free energies of solvation in water or n-octanol [REF2] as min[deltaG_exp-((E_{EC-RISM}+c1*mu_{ex}+c2*PMV_{EC-RISM}+c3*q)-E_{vac}] with E_{EC-RISM} being the QM-energy of the molecule after convergence of the EC-RISM cycle, mu_{ex} the excess chemical potential, PMV_{EC-RISM} the partial molar volume as calculated by EC-RISM, q being the net charge of the molecule and E_{vac} taken from the same quantum chemical level of theory in vacuum. The correction (c1*mu_{ex}+c2*PMV_{EC-RISM}) was then applied to the raw EC-RISM energies since only neutral species were considered for the calculation of the log P. All corrections for water have a fixed parameter c1 = 1 since this additional parameter was found to be of no predicitve value in previous challenges [REF3]. In case of models ending with 2o the parameter c1 was optimized for n-octanol while in case of models ending with 1o the parameter was fixed to c1 = 1.
The log P of a compound was then calculated by log P=(G_{oct}-G_{wat})/(-RT ln(10)), where G_{m} refers to the partition function estimate of the solvent specific free energy by summing over the tautomer states.
The SEM was estimated as the convergence criterion for a single EC-RISM calculation. The uncertainty was estimated as the RMSE of the n-octanol-water transfer free energy dataset contained within the Minnesota Solvation Database.
