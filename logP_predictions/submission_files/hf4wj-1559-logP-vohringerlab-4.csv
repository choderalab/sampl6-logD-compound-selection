Method:

To obtain partition coefficients of the 11 molecules, the Hirshfeld-I electron density partitioning method (doi:10.1063/1.2715563) was used to calculate atomic charges from the polarized solute molecular electron density with the SMD solvation model and combined with the parameters of the GAFF force field. Solvation and hydration free energies were obtained with the SPC/E water model and the octanol parameters from GAFF in alchemical free energy calculations.

Conformers from the smiles strings were created with rdkit and pre-optimized using the MMFF94s force field. Each conformer was optimized further with the PM7 method in MOPAC2016 and its solvation free energy estimated with QM calculations using the BLYP/def2-TZVP and the SMD solvation model. Only the lowest conformer were used for the calculation of the atomic charges and the free energy calculations.

The atomic charges of this conformer were obtained from the molecular electron density of geometry optimized structures at the BLYP/def2-TZVP level of theory calculated with the ORCA package 4.0.0.2 (doi:10.1002/wcms.81), the SMD solvent model (doi:10.1021/ct900312z) and the dielectric constant of water and octanol, respectively. The partitioning of the molecular electron density in atomic charges was achieved with the Hirshfeld-I method as implemented in the HORTON package version 2.0.0. After the calculation of atomic charges, chemically equivalent atoms, which result from molecular symmetry or free rotations, e.g., hydrogen atoms in methyl group, were identified with the OpenEye Python Toolkit (version 2017.2.1) and their charges were averaged. 

The Gibbs free energy of hydration for each molecule was obtained by alchemical free energy calculations conducted with standard protocols that keep errors due to sampling and free energy estimators relatively small. Each molecule was solvated in approximately 1500 water molecules or 150 octanol molecules, energy minimized with the GROMACS simulation package (doi:10.1016 j.softx.2015.06.001). The water molecules were described by the SPC/E (doi:10.1021/j100308a038) model. For octantol the parameters from the GAFF entry in the database in virtualchemistry.org were used.
After energy minimization, the whole system was equilibrated in the NPT ensemble at 298.15 K and 1 bar. The simulations were performed with the GROMACS 5.0.4 software package using a time step of 2 fs in combination with stochastic dynamics (doi:10.1080/08927028808080941) (tau = 2 ps) and the Parrinelloâˆ’ Rahman pressure coupling (doi:10.1063/1.328693) (tau p = 1 ps) algorithm using the compressibility of water or octanol. The electrostatic interactions were calculated with the Particle-Mesh-Ewald method (doi:10.1063/1.470117), a cutoff radius of 1.2 nm, a PME-order of 6 and a spacing of 0.1 nm. The van der Waals interactions were scaled to zero via a switching function, which switches the potential to zero between 1.0 and 1.2 nm. The neighbor list was updated every 10 steps with the verlet cutoff-scheme implemented in GROMACS 5.0.4 and its cutoff was set to 1.2 nm. All bonds were constrained with the LINCS algorithm (doi:10.1002/(SICI)1096-987X(199709)18) of order 4 and the isotropic correction to the energy pressure due to missing van der Waals interactions was applied.

The Gibbs free energy of hydration or solvation was then calculated from the equilibrated solvated systems with alchemical molecular dynamics simulations,  where the intermolecular interactions between each solute and the solvent were switched off through a lambda parameter using soft core potentials with values of sigma = 0.3 and alpha = 0.5 and p = 1 originally proposed by Beutler et al. (doi: 10.1016/0009-2614(94)00397-1) and implemented in Gromacs 5.0.4 package. First the electrostatic interactions were decoupled using the values of the lambda parameter [0.00, 0.25, 0.50, 0.75, 1.00] followed by the van der Waals interactions at values of [0.00, 0.05, 0.10, 0.20, 0.30, 0.40, 0.50, 0.60, 0.65, 0.70, 0.75, 0.80, 0.85, 0.90, 0.95, 1.00] (doi:10.1021/acs.jced.7b00104).  The total simulation time per value of lambda was 5 ns for the water and 15 ns for the octanol. The analysis of the free energy simulations was performed with different free energy estimators implemented in alchemical-analysis tool (doi:10.1007/s10822-015-9840-9) and the MBAR method (doi:10.1063/1.2978177) was used for final free energy estimates which also provides an error estimate. Free energies were corrected by the energy required to polarize the electron density and the final partition coefficients were calculated from the free energies propagating their respective errors.
