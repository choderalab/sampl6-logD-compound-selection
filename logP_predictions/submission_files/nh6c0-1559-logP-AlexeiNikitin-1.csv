Method:

The octanol-water partition coefficients (log P) were calculated as the difference of 
the solvation free energy of a substance in water and in aqueous octanol.
For each substance, two classical molecular dynamics simulations was made: the transition 
from vacuum to water, and transition from vacuum to a saturated solution of water in octanol.

Free energy was determined by Expanded Ensembles method.

The calculations were carried out on the so-called "alchemical coordinate" which was divided into 50-61 windows. 
In the first phase consisting of eight passes the balancing factors were determined. 
Each pass consisted of two back and forth passes (vacuum - solution) along the alchemical coordinate.
To obtain molecular mechanical trajectories, the Verlet integrator with the Bussi-Donadio-Parrinello thermostat 
and the Berendsen barostat was used.

In the second phase, consisting of 10â€“40 passes, statistics were collected for actual calculations of free energy.
The scatter in the number of passes and, accordingly, in the accuracy of the calculations is due to the fact 
that the length of the pass depends on the nature of the substance being modeled.
Statistical uncertainties are indicated on the basis of experience with other substances, depending on the number of passes in the second phase.

The calculations were carried out on personal computers with video cards supporting CUDA technology.


Pre-parametrization of MM models was carried out using an automatic parameterizer of Abalone.
Parameters of non-valent interactions were manually edited in many cases. In particular, based on the experience of the author, 
parameters for fluorine and chlorine that were missing in the program were added.
The general idea of parameterization is the AMBER/OPLS approach: the potential derived charges are used; 
Lennard-Jones parameters are taken in such way that the thermodynamic properties of simple liquids are reproduced.
