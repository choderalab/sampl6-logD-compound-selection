Data Selection	
A total of 97 molecules were selected from NIST’s list of partition coefficients.  The molecules were hand-chosen based on their structural similarity to the challenge set molecules.  
Multiple types of molecules, including aromatic rings, heterocyclic rings, ketones, esters, ethers, alcohols, and molecules containing N, O ,F, and Cl were chosen.  
For each molecule selected from NIST’s list, the corresponding recommended logP coefficient was also stored.
SMILES strings were retrieved using PubChem, and were transformed into 3-dimensional coordinates via Open Babel.  
Most descriptors were generated from quantum mechanical calculations, described below.

QM Methodology	
Structures were optimized with the B3LYP functional with Grimme's D3 dispersion correction with Becke-Johnson dampening and Dunning's cc-pVTZ basis set.
QM-generated QSAR descriptors were obtained with single point calculations with the PBE and PBE0 functionals with the cc-pVTZ basis set. The SMD implicit solvent model was used to simulate the effects of water and octanol.
All QM calculations were done in Gaussian16.

Descriptor Creation	
A total of 20 molecular descriptors were generated for each molecule in the training  and challenge sets.  Van der Waals volume and area was calculated using Zhao Et. Al’s fast calculation approach.  
This approach requires only knowing the number of bonds, count of each atom, and number of aromatic and nonaromatic rings present in each species.  It is invariant to geometric optimization techniques.	
HOMO/LUMO energies, as well as the energy gap between them, were calculated on the optimized structures by using the PBE DFT functional.  Calculations were performed using both water and octanol as a solvent.
Dipole moments were obtained directly from the calculated output of PBE calculations for both water and octanol.
Electronic superdelocalizability was calculated using Gaussian’s population analysis.	

Feature Selection and Exploratory Data Analysis	
Once descriptors were generated, feature selection and exploratory data analysis were performed.  Feature selection helps prevent overfitting in the model by trimming excess descriptors that contain mainly noise.  Exploratory data analysis is a visual way to show data and search for trends.
Univariate analysis was used to determine how well each descriptor correlated to the known, experimental logP values of the training set.  R2 was calculated separately for each descriptor vs. the logP value of the training set.	

Descriptor
Most descriptors had little to no correlation to logP, however results generally followed the trends discovered by Reddy Et. Al. 
Molecular properties calculated in water and octanol were being very highly correlated to each other, generally with an R2 value of above 0.98, so only water-calculated descriptors were used thereafter.
Ultimately, three descriptors were selected for modeling use:  Van der Waals Volume (VDWV), Dipole PBE Water, and Polarizability.  
By removing the extraneous descriptors that have little correlation to logP, overfitting in the machine learning model can be minimized.
Generally, it is desirable to have the training data set be as similar as possible to the set that the model is going to be applied to.  
In this case, doing so was not possible, because the challenge molecules were larger and contained more rings than most of the data available from NIST.

Modelling
After exploratory data analysis and feature selection was complete, multiple models were constructed in an attempt to best describe the correlation between the known logP values of the training set and the molecular descriptors. 
A multilinear regression model (MLR) and a more conservative Partial Least Squares (PLS) model were constructed to correlate the descriptors to logP.

PLS Model with Outliers removed	
A more conservative model was constructed. An outlier was defined as any molecule whose error in predicted logP value was more than three standard deviations away from the entire training set.  
Seven outliers were removed, leaving 90 molecules remaining in the training set.
Two latent variables were used.  
The PLS molecule explained 72% of the variance in the training set, had an RMSE of 0.55 and RMSECV of 0.65 via 5-fold cross-validation. 
This model was then applied to the challenge molecules to get logP.
