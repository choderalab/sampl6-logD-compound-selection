Method:  
For all compounds independent sets of relevant conformations were computed with the COSMOconf 4.3 workflow.1,2The quantum chemistry calculations of COSMO surfaces were done on the BP//TZVPD//FINE Single Point level based upon BP//TZVP//COSMO optimized geometries to match the parameterization used in COSMOtherm. The quantum chemical calculations were done with the TURBOMOLE 7.3 quantum chemistry software.3
The distribution coefficient logP between the pure solvent phases water and octanol was computed for all solutes using the COSMO-RS method as implemented in COSMOtherm, according to the following general procedure:
• For all compounds, a set of relevant conformations as generated by COSMOconf was taken into account.
• The octanol-water partition coefficient logP was computed from the chemical potential differences of the solutes in the two solvent phases.
Partition coefficients logP were calculated from the infinite dilution chemical potential differences of all solutes between solvents water and octanol. The solvent octanol was assumed to have water mole fraction content of 27.4%.  For the liquid phases experimental densities were used to convert from mole fractions to a concentration based definition of the logP. All COSMOtherm calculations (partitioning) were done with the BP_TZVPD_FINE_19  parameterization.4–6
The typical accuracy of the COSMOtherm BP_TZVPD_FINE_19  parameterization for the prediction of logarithmic partition coefficients is 0.35 log units (RMSD). For 262 non-polar solvent/water partition coefficients appearing in our parameterization and validation sets with exp. data taken from the Biobyte database the RMSD is 0.4 log units. Taking into account that the compounds in these datasets are in average smaller by a factor 2 than the compounds considered in the SAMPL6 challenge, and assuming uncorrelated errors, the estimated accuracy of the prediction of logP octanol-water is in the order of 0.5 log units.
As their is no random sampling involved the SEM is zero.
