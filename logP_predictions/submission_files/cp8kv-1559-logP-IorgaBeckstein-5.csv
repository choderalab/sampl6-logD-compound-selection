Method:
Alchemical free energy calculations were performed in explicit
solvent, following the protocol described in [1].  We used "dry"
octanol (water content 0 mol %).  Parameters were generated with  the
OPLSAA mol2ff software (B.I. Iorga, unpublished; also used in [1]) for
OPLS-AA with the TIP4P water model. Files were prepared for Gromacs
2018. The alchemical data were analyzed with thermodynamic
integration. Errors are reported as errors of the mean (see [1]). The
model uncertainty was estimated on the basis of an unpublished data
set of 92 compounds for which we computed errors for solvation free
energies in water and octanol.  [1] I. M. Kenney, O. Beckstein, and B.
