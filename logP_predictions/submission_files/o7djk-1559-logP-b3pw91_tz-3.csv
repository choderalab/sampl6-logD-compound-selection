Method:
Potential tautomer states were generated for each molecule and optimized using MP2/6-31g(d). Following, all structures were reoptimized using the B3LYP density functional with Dunning’s correlation consistent triple-zeta level basis sets (cc-pVTZ). For all Chlorine atoms, the cc-pV(T+d)Z basis set was used.

All structures were verified to be local minima via frequency calculations on an ‘ultrafine’ integration grid to obtain harmonic frequencies and vibrational contributions to the Gibbs free energy.

Single point energy calculations using the SMD implicit solvent to model water and octanol were performed on all tautomeric states using the B3PW91 functional in conjunction with Dunning’s correlation consistent basis sets. To model wet octanol,the dielectric constant of octanol was set to Eps=8.1. 
 
The logP was calculated using the transfer free energy of the respective tautomer state lowest in energy using the following equation:
logP = log([solute]octanol/[solute]water) = (\Delta G_water - \Delta G_octanol)*(log10e)/kT ,
where k is Boltzmann’s constant, T is temperature, e is Euler’s number and \Delta G is the free energy of solvation for each respective solvent.
