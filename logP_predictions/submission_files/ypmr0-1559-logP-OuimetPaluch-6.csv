logP's were computed from the difference in computed dimensionless solvation free energy
of the solute in water relative to 1-octanol at infinite dilution at 298 K and 1 bar using
the SM8 solvation model as implemented i n Q-Chem.

Starting with the provided SMILES for the SAMPL6 challenge, 3-D structures were generated using Open Babel and the
General Amber Force Field (GAFF). We performed a systematic conformation search to predict
the lowest energy conformer. The geometry was then optimized at the M06-2X/cc-pVDZ level of
theory/basis set. This vacuum optimized geometry was then used to compute the solvation
free energy in water and 1-octanol at the M06-2X/6-31G(d) level of theory/basis set with
the SM12 solvation model. All of the electronic structure calculations were performed with
Q-Chem.

Due to the nature of these calculations, the reported precision (or standard error of the computed
logP) is 0.0. Provided the same initial geometry and using the same electronic structure calculation
theory/basis set (with the same software), one should compute the same solvation free energy.
If the initial geometry or charge protonation state were to change, we would expect the
computed values to change. This, however, is beyond the scope of this study.

To estimate the model accuracy of the predicted logP values, we made predictions for a 
test set of 14 molecules with known logP values. The test set was created using
DrugBank.ca. Using the SAMPL6 structures, we performed a similarity search against
``approved'' drugs in the Drug Bank database to identify molecules with a similarity
score greater than 0.5 for which logP values were available. Calculations for the 
test set were identical to the that used for the SAMPL6 set, starting with SMILES provided
by Drug Bank. The RMS error of the predictions was taken to be the model error.
