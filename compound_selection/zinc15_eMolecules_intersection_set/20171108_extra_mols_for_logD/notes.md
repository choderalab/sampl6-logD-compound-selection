# Selecting extra soluble compounds for logD challenge.

I started from dataframe with pKa calculated Epik pKas for intersection set of ZINC Kinase and eMolecules. pKas outside 3-11 region and molecules with pKas closer than 1 pKa were already eliminated from this list:
df_pKa_interval_3-11_spread.csv 

$cp /sampl6-physicochemical-properties/compound_selection/zinc15_eMolecules_intersection_set/20170724_zinc15_eMolecules_subset_pKa_filter/df_pKa_interval_3-11_spread.csv .
