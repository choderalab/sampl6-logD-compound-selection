The microscopic pKa refers to the pKa of deprotonation of a single titratable group while all the other titratable and tautomerizable functional groups of the same molecule are held fixed.

Resonance structures or geometric isomers of compounds do not constitute seperate microstates. 
I will compare number of heavy atoms, total charge of the molecule and number of hydrogens bound to each heavy atom to detect unique or replicate microstate structures.

## Procedure

I will keep recording deprecated microstates in correction files:
corrections_for_v1_3_2 directory copied from ../corrected_microstates_v1_3_2

Follow these notebooks:
