## Procedure
Structures to be deprecated or added are recorded in Correction columns of SMX_correction.csv files. 
To create corrected microstate list (v1_3_1), run ipython notebook: update_microstate_lists_based_on_manual_correction.ipynb
Output file path: /microstate_lists_after_manual_correction
